% Write a predicate addone/2 whose first argument is a list of integers, and whose second argument is the list of integers obtained by adding 1 to each integer in the first list. For example, the query
% ?- addone([1,2,7,2],X).
% should give
% X = [2,3,8,3].

addone([X], [Y]) :- Y is X + 1.
addone([H | T], [H2 | T2]) :- H2 is H + 1, addone(T, T2), !.
