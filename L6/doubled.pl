% Let’s call a list doubled if it is made of two consecutive blocks of elements that are exactly the same. For example, [a,b,c,a,b,c] is doubled (it’s made up of [a,b,c] followed by [a,b,c] ) and so is [foo,gubble,foo,gubble] . On the other hand, [foo,gubble,foo] is not doubled. Write a predicate doubled(List) which succeeds when List is a doubled list.

doubled(List) :- append(X, X, List), !.

append([],L,L).
append([H|T],L2,[H|L3]) :- append(T,L2,L3).
